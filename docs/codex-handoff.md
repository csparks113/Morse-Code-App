# Codex Handoff Log

Use this document to capture the single source of truth after each working session. Update the sections below before ending work so future chats can resume without reconstructing context.

## Current Focus
- **Initiative:** Outputs rewire - Foundations & Benchmarks
- **Objective:** Validate dependency compatibility (react-native-audio-api, react-native-nitro-haptics) and baseline touch-to-output latency (tone/haptic/flash/torch).
- **Owner:** Codex pairing session (update with your initials if another contributor takes over).

## Latest Update
- **When:** 2025-10-02
- **Summary:** Documented the AudioAPI Gradle override approach, published the latency instrumentation blueprint, and drafted Nitro integration prep so implementation can start without re-running discovery.
- **State:** Ready to implement config plugins and scaffold the telemetry store before wiring native modules.

## Next Steps

1. Implement `plugins/withAudioApiAndroidConfig.ts` and thread it into the Expo config so prebuild writes AudioAPI compile/target/NDK overrides.
2. Scaffold `services/latency` plus developer console hooks per the blueprint and start emitting press/output samples.
3. Add Nitro dependencies (`react-native-nitro-modules`, `react-native-nitro-haptics`, `nitrogen`) and create the `withNitroCodegen` plugin to run codegen during prebuild/EAS.

## Verification
- **Outstanding checks:** `npx tsc --noEmit` still fails while expo-audio typings remain in the tree; expect to revisit after the rewire swaps the module.
- **Recent checks:** `npm run verify:handoff` (passes 2025-10-02).

## Reference Docs
- `docs/refactor-notes.md` - master backlog and daily log.
- `docs/outputs-rewire-plan.md` - detailed outputs strategy and milestones.
- `docs/developer-console-updates.md` - console instrumentation history.
- `docs/latency-instrumentation-blueprint.md` - touch-to-output telemetry capture plan.
- `docs/nitro-integration-prep.md` - New Architecture + Nitrogen setup checklist.

## Update Checklist (run this before ending a session)
- [ ] Summarize what changed in **Latest Update** (include paths where relevant).
- [ ] Refresh **Next Steps** so the first unchecked item is the next action.
- [ ] Note verification status in **Verification** (tests run, blockers, failing commands).
- [ ] Cross-link affected planning docs if new information was added.
- [ ] Run `npm run verify:handoff` and resolve any failures.

_Tip: Keep entries terse but explicit enough that a new chat can resume work immediately._
