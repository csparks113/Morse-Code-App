# Codex Handoff Log

Use this document to capture the single source of truth after each working session. Update the sections below before ending work so future chats can resume without reconstructing context.

## Current Focus
- **Initiative:** Outputs rewire – Foundations & Benchmarks
- **Objective:** Validate dependency compatibility (react-native-audio-api, react-native-nitro-haptics) and baseline touch-to-output latency (tone/haptic/flash/torch).
- **Owner:** Codex pairing session (update with your initials if another contributor takes over).

## Latest Update
- **When:** 2025-10-02
- **Summary:** Logged compatibility findings for `react-native-audio-api` and `react-native-nitro-haptics` (plugin defaults, SDK/NDK overrides, Nitro new-arch requirements) and updated planning docs.
- **State:** Ready to script the Gradle/expo-config overrides and move on to latency instrumentation baselines.

## Next Steps

1. Draft the Gradle/expo-config overrides (AudioAPI compile/target SDK, NDK, plugin options) and decide where to persist them before running `expo prebuild`.
2. Outline the latency instrumentation plan (press timestamps, OutputsService sinks, data schema) so the audit feeds straight into measurement work.
3. Prep Nitro integration steps: enable `newArchEnabled`, add `react-native-nitro-modules`, and define how Nitrogen codegen will run inside prebuild.

## Verification
- **Outstanding checks:** `npx tsc --noEmit` still fails while expo-audio typings remain in the tree; expect to revisit after the rewire swaps the module.
- **Recent checks:** `npm run verify:handoff` (passes 2025-10-02).

## Reference Docs
- `docs/refactor-notes.md` – master backlog and daily log.
- `docs/outputs-rewire-plan.md` – detailed outputs strategy and milestones.
- `docs/developer-console-updates.md` – console instrumentation history.

## Update Checklist (run this before ending a session)
- [ ] Summarize what changed in **Latest Update** (include paths where relevant).
- [ ] Refresh **Next Steps** so the first unchecked item is the next action.
- [ ] Note verification status in **Verification** (tests run, blockers, failing commands).
- [ ] Cross-link affected planning docs if new information was added.
- [ ] Run `npm run verify:handoff` and resolve any failures.

_Tip: Keep entries terse but explicit enough that a new chat can resume work immediately._
