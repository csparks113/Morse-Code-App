# Codex Handoff Log

Use this document to capture the single source of truth after each working session. Update the sections below before ending work so future chats can resume without reconstructing context.

## Current Focus
- **Initiative:** Outputs rewire - Foundations & Benchmarks
- **Objective:** Validate dependency compatibility (react-native-audio-api, react-native-nitro-haptics) and baseline touch-to-output latency (tone/haptic/flash/torch).
- **Owner:** Codex pairing session (update with your initials if another contributor takes over).

## Latest Update
- **When:** 2025-10-03
- **Summary:** Implemented the AudioAPI Gradle override plugin, instrumented keyer touch-to-output latency (tone/haptic/flash/torch), and made the developer console footer scrollable so all controls stay accessible.
- **State:** Ready to extend latency capture to replay/OutputsService pulses and stage the Nitro dependencies/codegen tooling.

## Next Steps

1. Extend latency capture beyond keyer presses (replay `playMorse`, flash/haptic pulses, torch) and drop in the shared press tracker helper.
2. Bring in Nitro dependencies (`react-native-nitro-modules`, `react-native-nitro-haptics`, `nitrogen`) and wire a `withNitroCodegen` plugin so prebuild/EAS run codegen automatically.
3. Convert `app.json` to `app.config.ts` (or equivalent) so we can parameterize plugin stacks before the Expo prebuild smoke test.

## Verification
- **Outstanding checks:** `npx tsc --noEmit` still fails while expo-audio typings remain in the tree; expect to revisit after the rewire swaps the module.
- **Recent checks:** `npm run verify:handoff` (passes 2025-10-03).

## Reference Docs
- `docs/refactor-notes.md` - master backlog and daily log.
- `docs/outputs-rewire-plan.md` - detailed outputs strategy and milestones.
- `docs/developer-console-updates.md` - console instrumentation history.
- `docs/latency-instrumentation-blueprint.md` - touch-to-output telemetry capture plan.
- `docs/nitro-integration-prep.md` - New Architecture + Nitrogen setup checklist.

## Update Checklist (run this before ending a session)
- [ ] Summarize what changed in **Latest Update** (include paths where relevant).
- [ ] Refresh **Next Steps** so the first unchecked item is the next action.
- [ ] Note verification status in **Verification** (tests run, blockers, failing commands).
- [ ] Cross-link affected planning docs if new information was added.
- [ ] Run `npm run verify:handoff` and resolve any failures.

_Tip: Keep entries terse but explicit enough that a new chat can resume work immediately._
