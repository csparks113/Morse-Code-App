# Codex Handoff Log

Use this document to capture the single source of truth after each working session. Update the sections below before ending work so future chats can resume without reconstructing context.

## Current Focus
- **Initiative:** Outputs rewire - Foundations & Benchmarks
- **Objective:** Validate dependency compatibility (react-native-audio-api, react-native-nitro-haptics) and baseline touch-to-output latency (tone/haptic/flash/torch).
- **Owner:** Codex pairing session (update with your initials if another contributor takes over).

## Latest Update
- **When:** 2025-10-03
- **Summary:** Migrated `services/outputs/defaultOutputsService` to the shared tone controller from `utils/audio`, so keyer playback now prefers `react-native-audio-api` with an Expo fallback, and latency telemetry records the active backend. Added the reusable `ToneController` helpers in `utils/audio.ts` and cleared the TypeScript errors.
- **State:** Morse tone utilities and outputs service now share the audio-api-first flow; pending real-device validation and plugin configuration review before enabling the Nitro specs end-to-end.

## Next Steps

1. Run on-device smoke tests (iOS/Android) to confirm the audio API path spins up quickly and latency logs capture backend metadata.
2. Confirm the audio API Expo plugin settings cover permissions/background needs and document any overrides in `docs/nitro-integration-prep.md`.
3. Flesh out the Nitro outputs specs (beyond the placeholder) and re-run `npx nitrogen` so generated bindings reflect the new orchestrator.

## Verification
- **Outstanding checks:** Device smoke tests for tone playback + latency logging on the audio API path.
- **Recent checks:** `npx tsc --noEmit` (2025-10-03); `npx nitrogen` (generates stubs, 2025-10-03); `npm run verify:handoff` (passes).

## Reference Docs
- `docs/refactor-notes.md` - master backlog and daily log.
- `docs/outputs-rewire-plan.md` - detailed outputs strategy and milestones.
- `docs/developer-console-updates.md` - console instrumentation history.
- `docs/latency-instrumentation-blueprint.md` - touch-to-output telemetry capture plan.
- `docs/nitro-integration-prep.md` - New Architecture + Nitrogen setup checklist.

## Update Checklist (run this before ending a session)
- [ ] Summarize what changed in **Latest Update** (include paths where relevant).
- [ ] Refresh **Next Steps** so the first unchecked item is the next action.
- [ ] Note verification status in **Verification** (tests run, blockers, failing commands).
- [ ] Cross-link affected planning docs if new information was added.
- [ ] Run `npm run verify:handoff` and resolve any failures.

_Tip: Keep entries terse but explicit enough that a new chat can resume work immediately._
