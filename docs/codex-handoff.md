# Codex Handoff Log

Use this document to capture the single source of truth after each working session. Update the sections below before ending work so future chats can resume without reconstructing context.

## Current Focus
- **Initiative:** Outputs rewire - Foundations & Benchmarks
- **Objective:** Validate dependency compatibility (react-native-audio-api, react-native-nitro-haptics) and baseline touch-to-output latency (tone/haptic/flash/torch).
- **Owner:** Codex pairing session (update with your initials if another contributor takes over).

## Latest Update
- **When:** 2025-10-03
- **Summary:** Relocated the project to `C:\dev\Morse`, regenerated native artifacts, and produced a fresh Android dev client that bundles `react-native-audio-api` and `expo-linear-gradient`; the app now launches on the Galaxy S22+ and is ready for latency smoke testing.
- **State:** Android dev client installed with the audio-api-first path active; latency validation and optional wake-lock/torch follow-ups remain outstanding before wiring the Nitro orchestrator.

## Next Steps

1. Run the Android smoke test (Developer Console -> Latency) and capture backend/latency samples for keyer presses and replay playback.
2. Record the results (pass/fail, latency metrics, backend) in `docs/refactor-notes.md` and update planning docs with any follow-up tasks.
3. Decide on production wake-lock/torch permissions and document the final override plan in `docs/nitro-integration-prep.md` before enabling Nitro bindings end-to-end.

## Device Smoke Test Checklist
1. Install dependencies with `npm install` and ensure your Expo CLI is logged in.
2. Build the dev client with New Architecture enabled:
   - iOS: `npx expo run:ios --device` (or `--configuration Release` when profiling).
   - Android: `npx expo run:android --device` (use the short project path to avoid Windows MAX_PATH issues).
3. Start the bundler with `npx expo start --dev-client --clear` and connect the device via the Expo dev client.
4. In-app, open the Developer Console -> Latency card and confirm tone samples log `backend=audio-api` after triggering keyer presses.
5. Hold and release the keyer button several times; watch for immediate sidetone start/stop with latency deltas < 15 ms.
6. Trigger a replay (practice/session playback) to ensure the native `playMorse` path runs without falling back to Expo.
7. Capture any anomalies (fallback to Expo, delayed start/stop, console errors) and note results in `docs/refactor-notes.md` under **Completed (Today)** or follow-up tasks.

## Verification
- **Outstanding checks:** Device smoke tests for tone playback + latency logging on the audio API path.
- **Recent checks:** `npx expo run:android --device` (2025-10-03); `npx tsc --noEmit` (2025-10-03); `npx nitrogen` (generates stubs, 2025-10-03); `npm run verify:handoff` (passes).

## Reference Docs
- `docs/refactor-notes.md` - master backlog and daily log.
- `docs/outputs-rewire-plan.md` - detailed outputs strategy and milestones.
- `docs/developer-console-updates.md` - console instrumentation history.
- `docs/latency-instrumentation-blueprint.md` - touch-to-output telemetry capture plan.
- `docs/nitro-integration-prep.md` - New Architecture + Nitrogen setup checklist.

## Update Checklist (run this before ending a session)
- [ ] Summarize what changed in **Latest Update** (include paths where relevant).
- [ ] Refresh **Next Steps** so the first unchecked item is the next action.
- [ ] Note verification status in **Verification** (tests run, blockers, failing commands).
- [ ] Cross-link affected planning docs if new information was added.
- [ ] Run `npm run verify:handoff` and resolve any failures.

_Tip: Keep entries terse but explicit enough that a new chat can resume work immediately._
